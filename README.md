# **PP5 - Taxi In Killarney Full Stack E-Commerce Site**

## **Summary:**
Taxi In Killarney was a site I initially designed for my PP1 Front-End Project. Based within the requirements of PP5 I decided to expand on my original design turning it into a fully functional full-stack e-commerce site. The site has currently been developed for educational purposes however I have designed it with the hopes of turning it into a working e-commerce site with the goal of helping my Father to increase revenue and traffic to his small self-employed taxi business based in Killarney Co.Kerry
